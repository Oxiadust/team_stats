- The application was made with ReactJS

1 - To set it up on your local, you will need to install NodeJS on your computer

You can  either download it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/  here or install it via command line.

after nodjs is installed, type the command line
npm install 
on the the folder, to add the node_modules depencies.

2 - You will also need to install a json server with the command line below

npm install json-server

and run the json file in my folder with the command line below

json-server --watch winnipeg.json

it will output you with a default ressource that look like that:
http://localhost:3000/winnipeg

if the port is different, please update it in src/app.js on the line number 8

3 - and finally once you are in the application folder, via the terminal, just run the application 

with the command line below to launch the application.

npm start

Thank You!
